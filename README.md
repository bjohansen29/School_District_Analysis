# School District Analysis


# Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis was performed on behalf of client PyCity School District in order to look deeper into factors that may affect reading and math scores at individual schools within the district. Upon discovery of anomalous scores within one grade at one school, further analysis was performed re-examining scores across the district with the removal of the anomalies.
